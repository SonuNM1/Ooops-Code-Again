### Outlet 

- In React, <Outlet/> is a component from React Router that acts as a placeholder for rendering child routes inside a parent route. It is mainly used when you have nested routes. 

- When a parent route is matched, <Outlet/> renders the corresponding child route inside it. 

- It helps in structuring layouts where multiple pages share a common layout, like a navbar or sidebar.
